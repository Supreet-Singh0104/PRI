**Prompt:**

Create a high-fidelity, professional software architecture diagram for a system called "Patient Report Intelligence". The diagram should visualize a **Hybrid Agentic RAG Pipeline** flowing from Left to Right. Use a clean, modern aesthetic with rounded rectangles for nodes and distinct color coding for different phases.

**Visual Layout & Components:**

1.  **Phase 1: Ingestion & Privacy (Left)**
    *   **Input Icon**: A PDF Document icon labeled "Patient Report".
    *   **Process Node**: An arrow leads to a "Shield Icon" labeled "PII Anonymizer" (representing privacy masking).
    *   **Process Node**: Next is a "Wrench Icon" labeled "Unit Normalization".

2.  **Phase 2: Triage (Center-Left)**
    *   **Decision Diamond**: A diamond shape labeled "Abnormal Filter".
    *   **Path A (Routine)**: A dotted line going down to a "Log Icon".
    *   **Path B (Critical)**: A solid line going right to a "Chart Icon" labeled "Trend Analysis", then to a "Siren Icon" labeled "Escalation Manager".

3.  **Phase 3: Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval (Background / Top)**
    *   Two cylinders representing databases feeding into the Agentic Loop:
        *   **Cylinder 1**: "Local Guidelines (ChromaDB)".
        *   **Cylinder 2**: "Web Search (Tavily API)".

4.  **Phase 4: The Agentic Cognitive Loop (Center - The Core)**
    *   Draw a large circular or cyclic layout representing the "Reasoning Engine".
    *   **Central Node**: A "Brain Icon" labeled "Planner Node".
    *   **Satellite Nodes** surrounding it:
        *   "Specialist Agent" (Doctor Icon).
        *   "Medication Agent" (Pill Icon).
        *   "Dietary Agent" (Apple Icon).
        *   "Correlation Agent" (Link Icon).
    *   **Critical Step**: An arrow leaving the loop points to a "Magnifying Glass Icon" labeled "Adversarial Critic" (Red Teaming).

5.  **Phase 5: Output Safety Chain (Right)**
    *   **Linear Sequence**: The Critic points to a "Document Icon" labeled "Summarizer".
    *   **Safety Checks**:
        *   "Shield Icon" (Safety Policy).
        *   "Book Icon" (Citation Enforcer).
        *   "Checkmark Icon" (Verify Node).
        *   "Unlock Icon" (Restore PII).
    *   **Final Output**: A "Dashboard/PDF Icon" labeled "Final Clinical Report".

**Style Notes:**
*   **Colors**: Use *Blue* for Ingestion, *Purple* for RAG/Databases, *Orange* for the Agentic Loop, and *Green* for the Safety/Output chain.
*   **Arrows**: Use directional arrows to show the flow. Use a circular arrow for the "Agentic Loop".
*   **Labels**: Ensure text is legible and professional (San Serif font).
*   **Background**: White or very light grey clean background.
