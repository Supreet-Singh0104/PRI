\section{Conclusion and Future Scope}

This research validates that the convergence of Agentic AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) marks a critical evolution from passive medical data processing to active "System 2" clinical reasoning. By implementing *Patient Report Intelligence* (PRI)—a cyclic, graph-based orchestration engine—we enabled dynamic collaboration among specialized agents, moving beyond linear automation. Experimental validation (N=10) confirms that this approach significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 100\% sensitivity for critical drug interactions with zero hallucinations. These results, underpinned by our novel "Safety Chain" methodology, demonstrate that establishing a self-corrective Cognitive Loop is essential for deploying transparent, evidence-based AI in high-stakes healthcare settings.

Looking forward, the scope of this research will expand across three dimensions. First, we aim to incorporate multimodal capabilities, allowing agents to correlate text-based pathology reports with DICOM imaging data for comprehensive diagnostic oversight. Second, we plan to deepen the system's interoperability by integrating directly with Electronic Health Record (EHR) infrastructure via FHIR standards, enabling real-time, longitudinal patient surveillance rather than snapshot analysis. Finally, future iterations will leverage Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to refine the Adversarial Critic's sensitivity, creating a system that evolves through interaction with expert clinicians. Ultimately, this work establishes a robust blueprint for the next generation of transparent, autonomous, and clinically grounded AI partners.
